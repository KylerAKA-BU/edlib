# Brief

This is a slimmed down version of [Edlib](https://github.com/Martinsos/edlib).
It contains the original code for calculations, all credit to original author.
Many test scripts and extended features are removed, as well as build files for
tools outside of CMake.

The main feature of this fork is a wrapper script for obtaining the NICE alignment
strings from simple command line input. This simplification is for easy adaptation
into a perl based pipeline.
